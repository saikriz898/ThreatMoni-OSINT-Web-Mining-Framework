### Layer Specifications

1. **OSINT Acquisition Layer:** Collects structured and unstructured intelligence across heterogeneous web sources (News sites, RSS feeds, CVE/NVD vulnerability databases, CERT advisories, security blogs).
2. **Web Mining Layer:** Crawls HTML pages, parses RSS feeds, calls REST APIs, and extracts structural metadata.
3. **Preprocessing Layer:** Removes duplicate entries, imputes missing records, cleans text formatting, and preserves technical indicators (`CVE-*`, IPv4 addresses, cryptographic hashes, MITRE IDs).
4. **Extraction & Correlation Layer:** Evaluates Source Credibility Scores (SCS), performs Named Entity Recognition (NER), extracts IOCs, and links extracted entities to the Threat Knowledge Base.
5. **Feature Engineering Layer:** Constructs multi-dimensional feature vectors including Threat Frequency (TFS), Source Reliability, Attack Vector, Geographic Location, and Intelligence Quality (IQ).
6. **Machine Learning Layer:** Benchmark classifiers (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes, XGBoost) fit on scaled training features ($X_{\text{train}}$) to predict threat categories.
7. **Horizon Scanning Layer:** Synthesizes SCS, TFS, IQ, and Risk Scores to calculate Threat Priority Index (TPI) metrics and identify high/critical priority threats.
8. **Visualization & Dashboard Layer:** Renders real-time interactive figures, comparative tables, record search interfaces, and threat maps.
9. **Decision Support Output Layer:** Exports executive research reports (`ThreatMoni_Final_Report.md`), paper-ready markdown tables, and multi-sheet Excel workbooks (`ThreatMoni_Results.xlsx`).
